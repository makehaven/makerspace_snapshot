# Makerspace Snapshot Module

The Makerspace Snapshot module is a Drupal module designed to capture and store periodic snapshots of membership data for reporting and analysis. It provides a flexible and configurable way to track key metrics over time, with a focus on providing data to dashboard environments.

## Features

- **Configurable Snapshot Intervals:**  Schedule snapshots to be taken daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually.
- **Manual Snapshots:** Manually trigger snapshots for testing or ad-hoc analysis.
- **Test Data:** Mark snapshots as "test" data, allowing them to be easily identified and deleted.
- **Configurable SQL Queries:** Define the SQL queries used to generate snapshot data, allowing the module to be adapted to any database schema.
- **API Endpoints:** Exposes a set of API endpoints for retrieving snapshot data in a format suitable for dashboard consumption.
- **Data Seeding:**  Includes a data seeding mechanism to provide sample data on a fresh installation.

## Installation

1.  **Enable the module:** Install the module as you would any other Drupal module.
2.  **Configure SQL queries:** Navigate to the snapshot configuration page at `/admin/config/makerspace/snapshot` and update the SQL queries to match your database schema. The module provides default queries that use benign example views, so the UI will render even before a real SQL is provided.
3.  **Configure snapshot interval:**  Select the desired snapshot interval from the dropdown menu on the configuration page.

## How to Set Up SQL Views

The module relies on a set of SQL views to retrieve the data for snapshots. You will need to create these views in your database. The following is a list of the required views and the expected fields for each:

-   **`your_view_active_members`**:
    -   `member_id`: The unique identifier for the member.
    -   `plan_code`: The machine name of the member's plan.
    -   `plan_label`: The human-readable label for the member's plan.
-   **`your_view_paused_members`**:
    -   `member_id`
    -   `plan_code`
    -   `plan_label`
-   **`your_view_lapsed_members`**:
    -   `member_id`
    -   `plan_code`
    -   `plan_label`
-   **`your_view_joins_in_period`**:
    -   `member_id`
    -   `plan_code`
    -   `plan_label`
    -   `joined_on`: The date the member joined, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
-   **`your_view_cancels_in_period`**:
    -   `member_id`
    -   `plan_code`
    -   `plan_label`
    -   `canceled_on`: The date the member canceled, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

## Development
